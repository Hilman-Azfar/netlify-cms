# netlify-cms
## Motivations

After a discussion with a developer, he brought up a concept called headless CMS with react. Essentially, it combines the strength of react, a fast frontend library and any CMS solution like wordpress. This is really cool as we can build app and websites from a single data source. This also means the developer and content creator can work independantly.
In this project, I want to dive in to technologies that can make this happen.

## To do

- [] static site using gatsby
- [] integrate netlify cms
- [] set up continous integration
