description: Who am I and where is this runaway train heading to?

It's me Hilman! I am a fullstack developer from Singapore. I created this blog with the sole purpose of documenting my growth as a software developer. This will serve as an archive and tool for reflection. To see how much I have progressed. I will be posting my learning experiences and sharing projects/articles/advice I have come across. There is much to say here so here is a picture of my cat.
